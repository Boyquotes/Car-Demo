Fork of original [Car Demo](https://github.com/HotHead007/Car-Demo) that includes my personal preferences:  

- Each wheel renamed from "Wheal0" to "wheel_front_left" accordingly
- Rotated each part of the car and tweaked code to fix wheel orientation (original had wheels with opposite direction and applied negative engine force)
- Refactored BaseCar.gd script, decoupled the HUD
- Tweaked main scene
